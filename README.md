# Ternion Waitlist Page

A futuristic, retro-tech styled landing page for a product waitlist. The design features a blend of structured and organic shapes, a real-time countdown timer, and a user form.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Retro-Tech Aesthetics:** A dark theme with pixel-art-inspired background patterns, glowing shadows, and animated icons.

* **Dynamic, Freeform Shapes:** The main container and the countdown timer elements use CSS animations to create a unique, lumpy, "blobby" shape, giving the page an organic feel.

* **Real-time Countdown:** A JavaScript-powered timer counts down to a future launch date.

* **Structured Waitlist Form:** A clean, easy-to-use form for collecting user information, featuring simple rectangular fields for clear interaction.

* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and looks great on both mobile and desktop screens.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the page structure.

* **Tailwind CSS:** Used via a CDN for rapid, utility-first styling.

* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For the countdown timer logic and form submission handling.
